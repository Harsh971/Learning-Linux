# Basics of Networking in Linux

## Introduction :
Networking is a fundamental aspect of cloud computing and DevOps, enabling communication between different systems, services, and resources. In Linux environments, networking plays a crucial role in facilitating connectivity, data transfer, and resource management.

## Key Concepts :
**1. IP Addressing:**
- IP (Internet Protocol) addresses uniquely identify devices on a network.
- IPv4 and IPv6 are the two main versions of IP addressing used in networking.
- Subnetting allows for the segmentation of IP address space into smaller, manageable networks.

**2. Network Interfaces:**
- Network interfaces, also known as network adapters or NICs, are hardware or virtual devices used to connect a computer to a network.
- In Linux, network interfaces are typically named eth0, eth1, wlan0, etc.

**3. Routing:**
- Routing involves directing network traffic between different networks or subnets.
- Dynamic routing protocols like BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) are used for automatic route discovery and updating.

**4. DNS (Domain Name System):**
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access resources on the internet using human-readable names.
- The /etc/resolv.conf file contains DNS server configuration settings in Linux.

**5. Firewalls:**
- Firewalls are security mechanisms that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
- iptables and firewalld are popular firewall management tools in Linux.
- Firewalls help protect systems from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and network-based threats.

## Network Stack :
At the core of Linux networking is the network stack, which consists of multiple layers responsible for handling different aspects of network communication. The key layers include:

**1. Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium, such as Ethernet cables, wireless signals, or optical fibers.<br>
**2. Data Link Layer**: Handles the transmission of data frames between devices on the same network segment, typically using protocols like Ethernet or Wi-Fi.<br>
**3. Network Layer:** Manages the routing of data packets across different networks, using protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) to ensure proper addressing and delivery.<br>
**4. Transport Layer:** Provides end-to-end communication between applications running on different hosts, using protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).<br>
**5. Application Layer**: Facilitates communication between applications running on different hosts, using protocols like HTTP, FTP, SSH, and SMTP.<br>
